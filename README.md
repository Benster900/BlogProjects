## Graylog v3
[Install/Setup Graylog 3 on Ubuntu 18.04 - Zeeks logs + threat intel pipeline](https://holdmybeersecurity.com/2019/03/27/install-setup-graylog-3-on-ubuntu-18-04-zeeks-logs-threat-intel-pipeline/)

This blog post is how to setup up Graylog version 3 on an Ubuntu server 18.04 with your choice of a manual install, Ansible, or Docker. Once Graylog is running, I have instructions on shipping NGINX logs with Rsyslog and Zeek/BRO logs in JSON format with Filebeat. Once the logs are ingested, we will create logging inputs, data extractors,  pipelines for threat intelligence, Slack alerts, and a dashboard to view Zeel logs.
